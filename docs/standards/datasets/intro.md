# Datasets

A dataset is a logical grouping of data for the purpose of access control and retention.

A data set may in specific situations require further partitioning to comply with privacy or 
contextually appropriate security requirements such as isolation of data within a region or
a security zone such as the EU for the purpose of GDPR.
